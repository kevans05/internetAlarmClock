<h1>About This Project</h1>

<p>
  SchoolProject We will be building an Internet Radio Alarm Clock which will allow you to play radio stations off the web. At the same time this Alarm Clock will have the functions of any normal alarm clock. We are hoping to give this project a good looking design as well, but still be able to function smoothly.

The major purpose of this project is to allow people listen to any radio station they desire in any location. Many people travel regularly for work, they will now be able to tune in and listen to their favourite station from home. This would also allow radio news from home to be heard anywhere as well as other useful information.
