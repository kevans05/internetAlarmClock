Description: python-wifi - README
        ====================
        
        I startet to write a python library which reads wireless data from the
        kernel like the wireless extensions. In order to know how to handle all
        this binary encrypted C structure stuff, Guido Goldstein from Infrae
        helped me to getting started. Thanks to him!
        
        I want to see some output!
        --------------------------
        I've implemented some example programs which use the functionality of
        the libraries. You'll find them in the 'examples' directory. 
        
        
        Files:
        ------
        
            - pyiwconfig, pyiwlist: the corresponding python programs to the C
              correspondents. These are example implementations.
            - iwlibs.py: handles all the black magic ;)
        
        
        Python Wifi users:
        ----------------------
        If you want to use the wirless library, the methods in the Wireless
        class are the ones you want. Lets assume a little example program, which
        prints the ESSID:
        
        >>> from pythonwifi.iwlibs import Wireless
        >>> wifi = Wireless('eth1')
        >>> wifi.getEssid()
        'romanofski'
        >>> wifi.getMode()
        'Managed'
        
        
        What is implemented?
        --------------------
        
            - pyiwconfig: 
                
                    read                                write
                    --------------------------------||--------

            - pyiwlist: prints detailed information about:

                    o Scanning support!
